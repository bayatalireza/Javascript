                Taking responsibility practicing 100 percent responsibility
                every day is about seeing ourselves not as right or wrong, but
                as an agent, chooser, problem solver, and learner in
                <a href="http://google.com">google</a> complex
                interrelationships of our lives so that we can better integrate
                with the people and world around us. When we do this, we enjoy a
                better and more productive way to live and lead.

                We have three roles here on earth: to learn, to love, and to
                live. When we stop learning, we start to stagnate and die. When
                we stop loving, we lose our sense of
                <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo</a> and become self-centered.
                When we limit our living, we deny the world the benefits of our
                talents

                The foundation stones of honesty, character, faith, integrity,
                love, and loyalty are necessary for a balanced success that
                includes health, wealth, and happiness. As
                <a href="http://youtube.com">youtube</a>you go onward and upward
                in life, you will discover that if you compromise any of these
                principles you will end up with only a beggar's portion of what
                life has to offer
